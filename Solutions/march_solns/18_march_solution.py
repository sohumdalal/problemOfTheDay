Problem Of The Day - 3/18/2025

Part 1: Create a BankAccount class with the following:

- Attributes: 
--- owner (str)
--- balance (float, default is 0)

- Methods:
--- deposit(amount): Adds to balance & prints "Deposited X".
--- withdraw(amount): Deducts balance (if sufficient funds) & prints "Withdrew X".
--- get_balance(): Returns balance.

Part 2: Modify BankAccount to store a history of all transactions.

- Attributes to add:
--- transactions (list of strings) â†’ Keeps track of all deposits/withdrawals.

- Methods to add:
--- print_transactions(): Prints all transactions in order.

Example Usage:
account = BankAccount("Alice", 100)
account.deposit(50)   # Deposited 50
account.withdraw(20)  # Withdrew 20
account.print_transactions()

# Output:
# Deposited 50
# Withdrew 20

Part 3: Bonus - Store a timestamp alongside each transaction

'''
# Solution 1: 

from datetime import datetime

class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, owner, balance=0):
        self.owner = owner
        self.balance = balance
        self.transactions = []

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount
        transaction = f"[{self._get_timestamp()}] Deposited {amount}"
        self.transactions.append(transaction)
        print(transaction)

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > self.balance:
            print("Insufficient funds")
            return
        self.balance -= amount
        transaction = f"[{self._get_timestamp()}] Withdrew {amount}"
        self.transactions.append(transaction)
        print(transaction)

    def get_balance(self):
        return self.balance

    def print_transactions(self):
        for transaction in self.transactions:
            print(transaction)
    
    def _get_timestamp(self):
        return datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

# Example Usage:
account = BankAccount("Alice", 100)
account.deposit(50)   # Deposited 50
account.withdraw(20)  # Withdrew 20
account.print_transactions()

# Expected Output:
# [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] Deposited 50
# [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] Withdrew 20
