Doubly Linked List

Implement a Doubly Linked List (DLL) in Python. Your DLL should have the following features:

Class: Node – please include the following attributes:
--- data: The value stored in the node.
--- prev: A reference to the previous node.
--- next: A reference to the next node.

Class: DoublyLinkedList – please include and test the following methods:
--- append(data): Adds a node with the given data to the end of the list.
--- prepend(data): Adds a node with the given data to the beginning of the list.
--- delete(data): Removes the first occurrence of a node with the given data.
--- search(data): Returns True if the data is found, otherwise False.
--- display_forward(): Prints the elements from head to tail.
--- display_backward(): Prints the elements from tail to head.

Sorting a Doubly Linked List (3/25)

Implement a sort() method that sorts the doubly linked list in ascending order.
Try to do this in-place without creating a new list.
Hint: You can use Insertion Sort since it works well with linked lists.
