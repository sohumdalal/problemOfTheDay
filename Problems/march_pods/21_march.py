Problem Of The Day - 3/21/2025

Part 1: Create a Node class and a LinkedList class.

Node Class: 
--- Stores value and next (pointer to next node).

LinkedList Class:
--- append(value): Adds node to the end.
--- prepend(value): Adds node to the beginning.
--- print_list(): Prints all values.

Part 2: Modify LinkedList to support the following:
- insert(value, index): Inserts value at index.
- delete(value): Removes the first occurrence of value.
- reverse(): Reverses the linked list in-place.
