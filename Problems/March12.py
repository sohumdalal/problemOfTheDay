Check If Number Is A Palindrome

Given an integer, write a function to check if it is a palindrome. A palindrome number is a number that reads the same forward and backward.

Examples:
Input: 121
Output: True

Input: -121
Output: False (negative numbers are not palindromes)

Input: 10
Output: False

Constraints:
The input is a 32-bit signed integer.
You cannot convert the integer to a string (for an extra challenge, avoid string-based solutions!).
