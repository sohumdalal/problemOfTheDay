Problem Of The Day - 3/31/2025

Implement a Binary Search Tree (BST) with three traversal methods:

preorder(callback): Visit root → left → right

inorder(callback): Visit left → root → right

postorder(callback): Visit left → right → root

Instead of using one-liners, move the function calls to the next line for clarity.

Hint: Use recursion to traverse the tree and apply the callback function.
