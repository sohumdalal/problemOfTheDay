Problem Of The Day - 4/25/2025:

Write a function that rotates a 2x2 matrix clockwise.

Input:
[
 [1, 2],
 [3, 4]
]

Output:
[
 [3, 1],
 [4, 2]
]


Bonus: Make it work for any square NxN matrix.

Let me know if you want a version where the rotation is done in-place or without using .reverse() and .zip() tricks.
