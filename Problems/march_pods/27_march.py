Problem Of The Day - 3/27/2025

Given a string s, determine if you can make it a palindrome by removing exactly one character.

Input: "radkar"  
Output: True  # Remove 'k' → "radar" (Palindrome)

Input: "abcdef"  
Output: False  # No single removal can make it a palindrome

Constraints:
--- s consists of only lowercase letters.
--- 1 ≤ len(s) ≤ 10⁵

Hint:
--- Try checking if s is already a palindrome.
--- If not, see if removing one character from the left or right makes it one.
