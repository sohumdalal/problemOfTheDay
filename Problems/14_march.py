Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Examples:
Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 

Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1

Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

Constraints:
The input string will contain only English letters, digits, symbols, and spaces.
The time complexity should be O(n), where n is the length of the string.
Hint: You can use a sliding window approach.
