Problem Of The Day - 4/10/2025:

Given two words beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary of words wordList, 
return the number of transformations required to convert beginWord to endWord by 
changing only one letter at a time â€” each intermediate word must exist in wordList.

from collections import deque

def word_ladder(beginWord, endWord, wordList):
    wordSet = set(wordList)
    if endWord not in wordSet:
        return 0

    queue = deque([(beginWord, 1)])

    while queue:
        word, level = queue.popleft()
        if word == endWord:
            return level

        for i in range(len(word)):
            for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':
                next_word = word[:i] + c + word[i+1:]
                if next_word in wordSet:
                    wordSet.remove(next_word)
                    queue.append((next_word, level + 1))
    return 0
